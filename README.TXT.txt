**********************
Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history. 
GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories.
 If you have open-source projects that use Git, then GitHub is designed to help you better manage them. 

Question: What Is Repository In GIT?

The purpose of Git is to manage a project, or a set of files, as they change over time. 
Git stores this information in a data structure called a repository.

Staging is a step before the commit process in git. That is, a commit in git is performed in two steps:
-Staging and
-Actual commit

GIT pull – It downloads as well as merges the data from the remote repository into the local working files.
This may also lead to merging conflicts if the user’s local changes are not yet committed.
